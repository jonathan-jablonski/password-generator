Password Generator

This website will be able to provide the user with a randomly generated password after asking the user what they would like their password to consist of in terms of types of characters (special, numeric, uppercased, and lowercased) upon pressing the 'Generate Password' button.

The user will then be able to copy this password and use it across their computer.
